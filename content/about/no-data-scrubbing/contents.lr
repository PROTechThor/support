No, it doesn't.
You need to use a separate program that understands your application and protocol and knows how to clean or "scrub" the data it sends.
Tor Browser tries to keep application-level data, like the user-agent string, uniform for all users.
Tor Browser can't do anything about the text that you type into forms, though.
