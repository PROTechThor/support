description:
Whenever we release a new stable version of Tor Browser, we write a blog post that details its new features and known issues.
If you started having issues with your Tor Browser after an update, check out <a href="https://blog.torproject.org">blog.torproject.org</a> for a post on the most recent stable Tor Browser to see if your issue is listed.
If your issue is not listed, please create a [GitLab issue](https://gitlab.torproject.org/groups/tpo/-/issues) about what you're experiencing.
